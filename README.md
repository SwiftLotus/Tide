# Tide
This is Tide for Swift.  It is based upon the libtide library developed by Martin Sustrik and upon the work done by the Zewo team in the Swift TCPIP package.

The libtide library and its headers is required for the swiftysockets package.  To build and install on your system:

```
git clone https://github.com/iachievedit/Tide
cd Tide
sudo make install
```

This will install header files in `/usr/local/include/tide` and `libtide.a` in `/usr/local/lib`.
